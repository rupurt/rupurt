### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software developer with a love for building tools.

I love the challenge of building complex distributed systems for large scale transactional
and analytical streaming workloads for domains such as high frequency trading, data
engineering and anomaly detection.

I've been fortunate enough to work with many great languages and tools over the years and have
enjoyed the opportunity to [publish](https://github.com/rupurt) much of my work as
open source code. I'm the author of the most popular Elixir trading libraries through
the [tai](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/tai) toolkit which can be composed as a full
CeFi/DeFi trading platform called [prop](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/prop).

I've learned a great deal about building reliable distributed systems in the presence of errors
through the Elixir/Erlang OTP ecosystem and have applied them in a golang streaming lakehouse
based on the [kappa](https://milinda.pathirage.org/kappa-architecture.com) architecture to help
tame dataflow to productively build ambitious, data driven & reactive applications in a library
called [tabletop](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/tabletop).
