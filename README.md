### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack software developer with a love for building tools.

I've fallen head over heels for Elixir and the BEAM runtime due to its developer productivity, performance and reliability, particularly under concurrent workloads.

I published a modular CeFi/DeFi trading platform in Elixir called [prop](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/prop). And extracted libraries 
to [ingest data from EVM blockchains](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/slurpee), cluster a fleet of 
[trading advisors](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/tai), configure the cluster with [simple DSLs](https://github.com/rupurt/juice) and 
[deploy](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/wrap) it all to production.

I [explore data](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/history) for fun and enjoy extracting insights that can be visualized or to make decisions.

I'm currently learning Rust.
